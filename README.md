# <h1 align="center"> Catapulta.sh Foundry Template </h1>

Template repository for getting started quickly with [Catapulta.sh](https://catapulta.sh/docs) Chain Ops Suite for Foundry projects.

Requirements

- [Git](https://gist.github.com/derhuerst/1b15ff4652a867391f03)
- [Node.js 18v](https://gist.github.com/d2s/372b5943bce17b964a79)
- [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/)

## Getting Started

Click "Use this template" on [GitHub](https://github.com/catapulta-sh/catapulta-foundry-template) to create a new repository with this repo as the initial state.

## Deploy your first contract with Catapulta

1. Git clone this repository and enter to the repository directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/catapulta-sh/catapulta-foundry-template
cd catapulta-foundry-template
```

2. Install forge dependencies

```
forge install
```

3. Generate a new private key with Catapulta, is stored offline in your .env, or add your own as `PRIVATE_KEY` in the .env file stored at the root of the project

```
npx catapulta wallet

# Output:
# Wallet address: 0x6B193d5604e09f1737E33cFc4B06fb3f2C7fC3CE
# Private key appended to your .env file.
```
4. Setup your `CATAPULTA_API_KEY` into your .env, generate one free key at [Catapulta](https://catapulta.sh/auth)
5. Deploy the basic contract into Sepolia testnet with Catapulta, using `--sponsor` flag to request gas. This skips the need of faucets.

```
npx catapulta script script/Deploy.s.sol --network sepolia --sponsor
```

```
